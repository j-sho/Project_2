# Project Udacity: Build a Portfolio Site

## About
I was provided with a design mockup as a PDF-file. I replicated the design in HTML and CSS and I developed a responsive website for different devices.
The design mockup is located here too.

## How to run
Run html file `index.html`.

## Contains
Within the download you'll find the following directories and files:
- index.html: html file with the structure of my website.
- design-mockup-portfolio.pdf: the mockup designed by Udacity.
- css directory: contains main.css file, that contain the style code for my website
- images directory: contains resized images for different screen devices (names of images contain information for which devices this images can be used (small, medium or large), and what type of ratio of devices (1x or 2x)) 

## Third-party code
I didn't use any third-party code.
